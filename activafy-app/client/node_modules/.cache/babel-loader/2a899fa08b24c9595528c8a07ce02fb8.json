The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not \n            provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. \n            <br/><br/>\n            The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may \n            litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.\n            <br/><br/>\n            <strong>Restrictions</strong><br/>\n            <p>The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually.
