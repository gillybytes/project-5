              <li>information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an email 
                address at which the complaining party may be contacted;</li>
              <li>a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the

              <li>a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act 
                on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed upon.</li>
            </ol>
            <strong>Counter Notification</strong><br/>
            If you believe your own copyrighted material has been removed from the Site as a result of a mistake or misidentification, you may submit a written 
            counter notification to [us/our Designated Copyright Agent] using the contact information provided below (a “Counter Notification”). 
            <br/><br/>
            To be an effective Counter Notification under the DMCA, your Counter Notification must include substantially the following: 
            <ol>

            </ol>

            we first receive notice from the party filing the Notification informing us that such party has filed a court action to restrain you from engaging in 
            infringing activity related to the material in question.
            <br/><br/>
            Please note that if you materially misrepresent that the disabled or removed content was removed by mistake or misidentification, you may be liable for 
            damages, including costs and attorney's fees. Filing a false Counter Notification constitutes perjury.

            <h5>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h5>
            <strong>Informal Negotiations</strong><br/>
            If a dispute arises between you and Activafy, our goal is to provide you with a neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. In the event of 
            a dispute we encourage you first to contact us to resolve your problem directly with us. You may contact us regarding any complaints or disputes at the Contact 
            Us portion of the Website.
            <br/><br/>
            To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms of Service (each a "Dispute" and collectively, the 
            “Disputes”) brought by either you or us (individually, a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute 
            (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party 
            to the other Party.
            <br/><br/>
            <strong>Binding Arbitration</strong><br/>
            If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and 
            exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. 
            <br/><br/>
            The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, 
            the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org.
            <br/><br/>
            Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.
            <br/><br/>
            The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not 
            provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. 
            <br/><br/>
            The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may 
            litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
            <br/><br/>
            <strong>Restrictions</strong><br/>
            <p>The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall 
            be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; 
            and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.</p>
